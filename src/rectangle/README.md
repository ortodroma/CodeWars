Write a program that figures out if 2 rectangles intersect with each other. A program must accept coordinates of 2 rectangles in a 2-D plane. It should return true if the rectangles intersect and false otherwise. The data structures used and programming language chosen (can also be pseudocode) is up to the candidate.
